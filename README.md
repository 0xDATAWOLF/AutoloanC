# AutoloanC - An Automobile Loan Calculator

A somewhat simple auto loan calculator built to be ran on the command line. It can be configured
to calculate a loan based the vehicle MSRP, trade-in value, down payment, APR, and term length.
This program is designed to be quick and easy, but also allows for data to be exported and/or
tabuluted for a range of term lengths beyond the requested.
